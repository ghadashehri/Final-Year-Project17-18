This folder contains
- 4 classes that performs DBSCAN algorithm
- 2 classes that performs PCA
- 4 classes that plots K-Distcane graphs
- 2 classes that evaluate clusters


the flow of progrmas, start with 
frequencyVector2 or BiGrams, Then KDistacne_Freq or KDistacne_BiGram (dpende on which feature set is used), after that running DBSCAN_Freq or DBSCAN_BiGram. 

The next step, includes performing PCA and running KDistancePCA, and then Dbscan algorithm.

All code is written in python. 
libraries such as, sklearn, numpy,  matplotlib, pandas are required.


NOTE:  the string directory_in_str should be modified, to where the samples.zip is included.
