# Clustering Android Application Behaviour
All programs are written in Python langauge (version 3.6). 
This directory contains two sub-folders

# 1- Proof of Concept
Each one of the programs, Extract features from Behavioural profiles, created by CopperDroid(.json). 
The feature extracted are then represented as vectors, since its suitable as inputs for  Clusterig Algorithms, which will be implemented later on.
it has 2 sub-directories:
* src > contains source code for feature extraction
* test > contains test cases for each of programs implemted

# 2- Clustering using DBSCAN 
Uses the vectors produced at earlier stages, as input and display them in clusters.

# 3- Samples
Which contains all CopperDroid's Analyised data (dataset in this case).
Each folder represent a malware family, that contains a number of samples. 
# 4- Interim Report
a directory that contains a copy of interim report
